# Design Patterns in C and C++
This repo contains a collection of helpful examples to demonstrate the use
of design patterns in C++.

The "gang_of_four" directory contains the code examples from the famous "Gang of Four"
book and modified for exposition by Douglas C. Schmidt.

The "embedded" directory contains the source code from the book "Design Patterns for Embedded Systems in C"
https://www.elsevier.com/books/design-patterns-for-embedded-systems-in-c/douglass/978-1-85617-707-8

The "gpp_code" directory contains the source code from the book available here:
http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/

I have modified and refactored various components of the code from each location in the
hope that it will make it more understandable and modern in places. This is a work in progress.

The "custom" directory contains a set of examples that I am currently in the process of completely
rewriting to hopefully make the general usage and intention of the pattern more clear.
